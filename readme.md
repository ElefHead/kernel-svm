# Kernel SVM

This repository contains the code for a simple kernel-svm that is used to fit a data that looks like sun and mountains. 

This work was done as an assignment of the course CS559 by Professor Erdem Koyuncu of University of Illinois at Chicago.

I don't have the original question, but the "sun and mountains" can be seen in the result image.
