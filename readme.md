# Kernel SVM

This repository contains the code for a simple kernel-svm that is used to fit a data that looks like *sun and mountains*. 

This work was done as an assignment of the course CS559 by Professor Erdem Koyuncu of University of Illinois at Chicago.

I don't have the original question, but the *sun and mountains* can be seen in the result image.

## Details 
Description of the data set randomly chosen based on given target function:  
* **In-set accuracy by maximum class classifier**: 57%
* **In-set accuracy using SVM classifier**: 100%

**Number of SVMs computed**: 14
**Number of SVMs in â€“ve class**: 8
**Number of SVMs in +ve class**: 6

**Kernel Used**: Radial Basis Function, gamma = 3
